# Project Name : Retinal Image Analysis for Diabetic Retinopathy  

# Problem statement :    
Diabetic Retinopathy is a disease with an increasing prevalence and the main cause of blindness among working-age population. The risk of severe vision loss can be significantly reduced by timely diagnosis and treatment. Systematic screening for DR has been identified as a cost-effective way to save health services resources. Automatic retinal image analysis is emerging as an important screening tool for early DR detection, which can reduce the workload associated to manual grading as well as save diagnosis costs and time. Many research efforts in the last years have been devoted to developing automated tools to help in the detection and evaluation of DR lesions.  

# Solution :   
I am proposing this solution to classify severity levels of DR ranging from 0 (NO DR) to 4 (Proliferative DR).   
This is a collaborative project of team of three where our main work is using developed, trained and tested CNN model along with some secondary work. 
A GUI based system has been made using Tkinter.
