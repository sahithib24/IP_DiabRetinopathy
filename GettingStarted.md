 Tip : Make sure to install [Numpy](https://pypi.org/project/numpy/), [Pandas](https://pypi.org/project/pandas/), [Matplotlib](https://pypi.org/project/matplotlib/) first and then proceed next.     
* [Torch package](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)    
* [Tkinter](https://tkdocs.com/tutorial/install.html)           

[Note you need mainly these four things to get started :]    
> [blindness.py](https://github.com/souravs17031999/Retinal_blindness_detection_Pytorch/blob/master/blindness.py)
> [model.py](https://github.com/souravs17031999/Retinal_blindness_detection_Pytorch/blob/master/model.py)
> [classifier.pt](#)

* Execute your 'blindness.py' file and your GUI must start (recommended to start this from your terminal and keep all your project files in same directory).   
* Upload the image and get your predictions.
